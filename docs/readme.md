# ZOC REXX Highlighting for VSCODE

This is the README for zoc-rexx-syntax-highlighting (based on 
[rexx-syntax-highlighting &ndash; REXX Highlighting for VS-Code](https://github.com/toms-place/rexx-syntax-highlighting)).

It is intended to offer syntax-highlighting for the [REXX flavor](https://www.emtec.com/zoc/onlinehelp.html?t=10610)
that [ZOC Terminal](https://www.emtec.com/zoc/index.html) offers
(see [ZOC REXX Examples](https://github.com/zocterminal/zoc-rexx-examples)), 
with support for the .zrx file name and the extra commands from
[ZOC-REXX Extensions](https://www.emtec.com/zoc/onlinehelp.html?t=10855).
